--------------ITS SLOW AS FUCK ------------------------
check how to manipulate array
--------------------------
change weight value using mfndependency node and plug:

import maya.api.OpenMaya as om


sel = om.MSelectionList()
sel.add("skinCluster1")
skinObj = sel.getDependNode(0)


skintest = om.MFnDependencyNode(skinObj)

weightPlug = skintest.findPlug("weightList", False)

#get the weight plug for the vertex id
vOneWeightPlug = weightPlug.elementByLogicalIndex(vertex ID)
#get the weightlist for the vertex.
weight = vOneWeightPlug.child(0)

#if the frist weight element is on index 1 in maya:
print weight.elementByPhysicalIndex(0).asDouble()
or
print weight.elementByLogicalIndex(1).asDouble()
